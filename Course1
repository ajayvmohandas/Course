Divide and Conquer Algorithms
In a "Divide and Conquer Algorithms" course, We dived deeper into a specific algorithmic strategy.
key concepts are:-
Divide: How to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
Conquer: How to solve the subproblems efficiently, either by solving them directly or by further dividing them.
Combine: How to combine the solutions of the subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem.
